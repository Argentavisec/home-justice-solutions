    <!-- What Are Housing Disrepair Rights -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="housing-rights-definition">
      <h2 id="housing-rights-definition">What Are Housing Disrepair Rights?</h2>
      <p><strong>Housing disrepair rights</strong> are the legal protections that tenants have to live in homes that meet minimum standards of safety, health, and comfort. These rights mean your landlord must repair and maintain the property, including the structure and essential installations, to prevent conditions that could cause harm or inconvenience.</p>

      <p>Housing disrepair can encompass a wide range of issues, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Damp and Mould:</strong> Caused by leaks, poor ventilation, or structural defects, this can lead to respiratory illnesses.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaking Roofs and Pipes:</strong> Water ingress can cause structural damage and damage to your belongings.</li>
        <li><strong>Faulty Heating Systems:</strong> Broken boilers or radiators leave tenants without adequate warmth during cold months.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrical Hazards:</strong> Exposed wiring, faulty sockets, or unsafe appliances risk fire or electrocution.</li>
        <li><strong>Broken Windows and Doors:</strong> Affect security and increase heating costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Structural Damage:</strong> Cracks, subsidence, or unstable flooring create safety hazards.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Under UK law, landlords have a duty to keep properties free from these types of disrepair, ensuring the home is “fit for human habitation.” These rights are supported by several laws we’ll discuss next.</p>

    <!-- Legal Framework -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="legal-framework">
      <h2 id="legal-framework">Legal Framework Governing Housing Disrepair Rights</h2>
      <p>Your housing disrepair rights are protected by a robust set of legal regulations and statutes in the UK. Understanding these laws helps you know what landlords must do and how you can enforce your rights.</p>

      <h3>1. Landlord and Tenant Act 1985</h3>
      <p>This act forms the core legal requirement for landlords to keep the structure and exterior of the property in repair. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Walls, roof, windows, doors, drains, gutters, and external pipes</li>
        <li>Installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, and sanitation (including basins, sinks, baths, toilets)</li>
        <li>Heating systems and hot water installations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your landlord fails in these duties, they breach this act and can be held legally liable.</p>

      <h3>2. Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018</h3>
      <p>This law strengthened tenant rights by requiring all landlords of rented homes to ensure the property is “fit for human habitation” throughout the tenancy period. It covers hazards that could affect health or safety, such as damp, mould, vermin infestation, and structural issues.</p>

      <h3>3. Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS)</h3>
      <p>The HHSRS is used by local councils to assess hazards in residential properties. If a property fails safety standards under the HHSRS, the council can enforce remedial action against the landlord.</p>

      <h3>4. Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998</h3>
      <p>Landlords must arrange annual gas safety checks by a registered engineer for all gas appliances, flues, and fittings. This is critical to tenant safety.</p>

      <h3>5. Electrical Safety Standards 2020</h3>
      <p>Landlords in England must have electrical installations inspected and tested at least every five years by a qualified person, ensuring the wiring and equipment remain safe.</p>

    <!-- Landlord Responsibilities -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="landlord-responsibilities">
      <h2 id="landlord-responsibilities">Landlord Responsibilities Under Housing Disrepair Rights</h2>
      <p>Your landlord is legally required to keep the rented property in a safe and livable condition. Key responsibilities include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Structural Repairs:</strong> Repairing walls, roofs, floors, windows, doors, and ensuring stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Plumbing and Drainage:</strong> Fixing leaks, blockages, and ensuring functioning water supply and sanitation.</li>
        <li><strong>Heating and Hot Water:</strong> Maintaining boilers, radiators, and hot water systems to provide adequate warmth and comfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrical Safety:</strong> Ensuring safe wiring, sockets, lighting, and appliances.</li>
        <li><strong>Gas Safety:</strong> Conducting yearly inspections and repairs on gas installations.</li>
        <li><strong>Damp and Mould:</strong> Addressing causes such as leaks or poor ventilation promptly.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Providing secure locks on windows and doors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Landlords must respond to repair requests within a reasonable time and carry out repairs diligently. Failure to meet these responsibilities may be grounds for a housing disrepair claim.</p>

    <!-- Enforcing Your Rights -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="enforcing-rights">
      <h2 id="enforcing-rights">How to Enforce Your Housing Disrepair Rights</h2>
      <p>When your landlord fails to maintain your property properly, you can take several steps to enforce your rights and get the repairs done:</p>

      <h3>1. Notify Your Landlord in Writing</h3>
      <p>Always report disrepair issues in writing — email or letter — clearly describing the problem and requesting repairs. Keep copies of all communication for evidence.</p>

      <h3>2. Give Reasonable Time for Repairs</h3>
      <p>Allow your landlord a reasonable timeframe to address the repairs, depending on urgency. Follow up if no action is taken.</p>

      <h3>3. Contact Your Local Council</h3>
      <p>If repairs are urgent or the landlord ignores you, your local council’s housing enforcement team can inspect the property and take enforcement action where necessary.</p>

      <h3>4. Seek Legal Advice and Support</h3>
      <p>Contact specialist housing disrepair solicitors who can advise you on your rights, assist with gathering evidence, and support you in making claims.</p>

      <h3>5. Make a Formal Claim</h3>
      <p>You may be able to make a formal claim for compensation if the disrepair has caused distress, inconvenience, or damage.</p>

    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="retaliation-protection">
      <h2 id="retaliation-protection">Protection Against Landlord Retaliation</h2>
      <p>One common fear among tenants is that landlords may retaliate by raising rent, threatening eviction, or harassment after complaints about disrepair. However, UK law protects tenants against unlawful retaliation.</p>

      <p>Key protections include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Landlords cannot evict tenants in retaliation for requesting repairs or making complaints.</li>
        <li>Tenants have rights to continue living in the property while disputes are resolved.</li>
        <li>Retaliatory eviction notices can be challenged in court.</li>

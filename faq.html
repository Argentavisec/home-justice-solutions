      <!-- Question 1 -->
      <article aria-labelledby="q1">
        <h3 id="q1">What is housing disrepair?</h3>
        <p>Housing disrepair refers to any faults or defects in a rented property that significantly affect its condition, safety, or habitability. This can include problems with the structure, fixtures, and installations that the landlord is legally obligated to maintain. Common issues include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Damp and mould growth</li>
          <li>Leaking roofs, windows, or plumbing</li>
          <li>Broken or inefficient heating systems</li>
          <li>Faulty electrical wiring or installations</li>
          <li>Structural damage such as cracks or subsidence</li>
          <li>Broken windows, doors, or locks</li>
          <li>Pest infestations due to neglect</li>
          <li>Blocked drains or inadequate sanitation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These problems can negatively affect your health, safety, and quality of life, and landlords have a legal duty to repair them promptly.</p>
      </article>

      <!-- Question 2 -->
      <article aria-labelledby="q2">
        <h3 id="q2">Who is responsible for repairs in rented properties?</h3>
        <p>In most rental agreements, the landlord is legally responsible for maintaining the structure and installations of the property in good repair. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The roof, walls, windows, and doors</li>
          <li>Heating and hot water systems</li>
          <li>Electrical wiring and safety</li>
          <li>Plumbing and drainage</li>
          <li>Ensuring the property meets health and safety standards</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tenants are typically responsible for minor repairs and for keeping the property reasonably clean and undamaged. However, if your tenancy agreement differs, always check its specific terms.</p>
      </article>

      <!-- Question 3 -->
      <article aria-labelledby="q3">
        <h3 id="q3">What legal rights do tenants have concerning housing disrepair?</h3>
        <p>Tenants have several legal protections designed to ensure that landlords maintain their properties adequately. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Landlord and Tenant Act 1985:</strong> Requires landlords to keep the structure and installations in good repair.</li>
          <li><strong>Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018:</strong> Ensures rental properties are safe and suitable for living throughout the tenancy.</li>
          <li><strong>Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS):</strong> A system councils use to assess and address housing hazards.</li>
          <li><strong>Protection from retaliatory eviction:</strong> Tenants cannot be evicted for making legitimate complaints.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your landlord fails in their repair duties, you have the right to demand repairs, seek compensation, and take legal action if necessary.</p>
      </article>

      <!-- Question 4 -->
      <article aria-labelledby="q4">
        <h3 id="q4">How do I report housing disrepair to my landlord or council?</h3>
        <p>Effective reporting is key to getting repairs done. Follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Notify in writing:</strong> Send a detailed letter or email describing the problem and requesting urgent repairs.</li>
          <li><strong>Include evidence:</strong> Attach photos, videos, or any other documentation of the disrepair.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep records:</strong> Save copies of all correspondence and note dates and times.</li>
          <li><strong>Report to your local council:</strong> If your landlord ignores your request, councils can enforce repairs under housing laws.</li>
          <li><strong>Use official complaints procedures:</strong> Escalate if initial reports do not lead to action.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Early, clear reporting increases your chances of fast repair and strengthens your legal claim if needed.</p>

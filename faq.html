    <!-- Section: What is housing disrepair? -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="what-is-disrepair">
      <h2 id="what-is-disrepair">What is Housing Disrepair?</h2>
      <p>Housing disrepair means defects or faults in a rented property that significantly affect its condition, safety, or habitability. Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Damp and mould growth</li>
        <li>Leaking roofs, windows, or plumbing</li>
        <li>Broken or inefficient heating systems</li>
        <li>Faulty electrical wiring or installations</li>
        <li>Structural damage such as cracks or subsidence</li>
        <li>Broken windows, doors, or locks</li>
        <li>Pest infestations due to neglect</li>
        <li>Blocked drains or poor sanitation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Such problems can cause health issues, damage belongings, and disrupt your daily life. Landlords are legally required to keep the property in good repair.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Who is responsible for repairs? -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="who-responsible">
      <h2 id="who-responsible">Who is Responsible for Repairs?</h2>
      <p>Typically, landlords must maintain the structure and installations of the property including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Roofs, walls, windows, and doors</li>
        <li>Heating and hot water systems</li>
        <li>Electrical wiring and safety</li>
        <li>Plumbing and drainage</li>
        <li>Ensuring health and safety standards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tenants usually handle minor repairs and general upkeep but must check their tenancy agreement for specifics.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: Legal rights -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="legal-rights">
      <h2 id="legal-rights">What Legal Rights Do Tenants Have?</h2>
      <p>UK tenants are protected by laws such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Landlord and Tenant Act 1985:</strong> Mandates landlords keep property structure and installations in repair.</li>
        <li><strong>Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018:</strong> Requires rented homes to be safe and suitable throughout the tenancy.</li>
        <li><strong>Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS):</strong> Used by councils to identify and tackle housing hazards.</li>
        <li><strong>Protection from retaliatory eviction:</strong> You cannot be evicted for making legitimate disrepair complaints.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your landlord fails these duties, you can demand repairs, seek compensation, and take legal action.</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Your Rights as a Council or Housing Association Tenant</h1>
    <p>As a tenant in the UK, you are legally entitled to live in a safe, secure, and well-maintained home. If you're renting from the <a href="search-your-council.html">council or a housing association</a> and have reported problems that haven't been fixed, you may be able to make a <strong>housing disrepair claim</strong>.</p>
    <p>At <strong>Home Justice Solutions</strong>, we specialise in helping tenants take action when landlords fail to uphold their responsibilities. Whether you're facing <a href="claim-types.html">mould, damp, structural issues, or faulty electrics</a>, we help you access free legal support and pursue compensation.</p>
    <a href="how-it-works.html" class="menu-cta">See How It Works</a>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Are My Legal Rights as a Tenant?</h2>
    <p>Under the <strong>Landlord and Tenant Act 1985</strong> and the <strong>Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018</strong>, social landlords (like councils and housing associations) have a legal obligation to keep your home in good repair. This is often called the landlord’s "duty of care."</p>
    <p>Your legal rights include the right to live in a property that is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Free from damp, mould, or rodent infestations</li>
      <li>Structurally sound with no loose ceilings or walls</li>
      <li>Warm and habitable, with working heating and hot water</li>
      <li>Safe to occupy, with functioning plumbing and electrics</li>
      <li>Secure, with locks and windows that close properly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your landlord fails to resolve these problems after you've reported them, they may be in breach of contract — and you may be entitled to <strong>repairs, rent refunds, and compensation</strong>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Should I Do If My Landlord Won’t Act?</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, many tenants are ignored when they raise repair issues — even if those issues are dangerous or affecting their health. If this happens to you, don’t give up. You have legal options.</p>
    <p>Here’s what you should do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Take clear photographs of the problem areas</li>
      <li>Send a written report to your landlord or housing officer</li>
      <li>Keep records of communication (emails, texts, etc.)</li>
      <li><a href="how-it-works.html">Start a disrepair claim</a> if they fail to act within a reasonable time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our process is fast and simple — fill in a <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250594347028056">60-second form online</a> and we’ll match you with a solicitor who can help take legal action on a no-win, no-fee basis.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Can I Claim Compensation For?</h2>
    <p>When your home is in disrepair and your landlord refuses to fix it, you may be owed compensation. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Damage to your belongings (e.g. clothes, bedding, furniture)</li>
      <li>✅ Illness or health problems caused by mould or cold</li>
      <li>✅ Emotional distress from living in unfit conditions</li>
      <li>✅ Rent refund for the time spent in unsafe housing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most successful claims fall between <strong>£1,000 and £10,000+</strong> depending on how serious the disrepair is and how long you’ve lived with it.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What If I’m Worried About Retaliation?</h2>
    <p>Some tenants worry that making a claim could get them evicted. But legally, your landlord <strong>cannot evict you for taking legal action</strong> about repairs. This is known as a “retaliatory eviction,” and it is illegal under UK housing law.</p>
    <p>You are protected, especially if you're a secure or assured tenant. If you're unsure about your tenancy type, check with your council or <a href="faq.html">see our FAQs</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Who Is Eligible to Claim?</h2>
    <p>We help tenants in <strong>council homes</strong> and <strong>housing association properties</strong> across England, Wales, and Scotland. You may be eligible if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You rent from the council or a housing association</li>
      <li>You have reported repairs that have not been completed</li>
      <li>Your health, safety or comfort has been affected</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not currently assist tenants with private landlords</strong>, but we can advise you on how to take the next steps if you're unsure who your landlord is.</p>

      <p>Roof leaks and faulty plumbing cause water damage to ceilings, walls, and floors, increasing repair costs and safety risks.</p>

      <h3>Electrical Faults and Hazards</h3>
      <p>Faulty wiring and outdated electrical systems are hazardous and can result in shocks, fires, or failure of essential appliances.</p>

      <h3>Structural Problems and Subsidence</h3>
      <p>Cracks, subsidence, and foundation issues threaten property safety and require professional surveys and urgent repair.</p>

      <h3>Pest Infestations</h3>

      <h2 id="your-rights">Understanding Your Housing Disrepair Rights</h2>
      <p>Every tenant in the UK has the right to live in a safe and habitable home. Landlords are legally obligated to maintain their properties and carry out repairs promptly. Our role is to educate you about these rights and help you enforce them.</p>
      <p>Housing disrepair can affect your health, safety, and quality of life. We explain what qualifies as disrepair, your landlord's duties, and the legal framework supporting tenants, including the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018.</p>
      <p>We guide you through recognising disrepair issues, reporting them correctly, and what to do if your landlord neglects repairs.</p>

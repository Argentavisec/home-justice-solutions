      <h2 id="section2-title">What is Housing Disrepair?</h2>
      <p><strong>Housing disrepair</strong> means faults or damage in a rented property that makes it unsafe, unhealthy, or unsuitable to live in. Under UK law, landlords are legally required to maintain their properties in a good state of repair and ensure they are safe for tenants.</p>
      <p>The most common forms of housing disrepair include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Damp and Mould:</strong> Caused by leaks or poor ventilation, leading to health risks such as asthma and respiratory infections.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaks and Water Damage:</strong> Persistent leaks through roofs, walls, or plumbing that can cause structural damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Heating and Hot Water Failures:</strong> Broken boilers or radiators leaving tenants without adequate heating.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrical Hazards:</strong> Faulty wiring, exposed cables, or unsafe sockets that increase the risk of fire or electric shock.</li>
        <li><strong>Structural Defects:</strong> Cracks in walls or ceilings, unstable flooring, or subsidence threatening building integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Pest Infestations:</strong> Rodents, cockroaches, or other pests due to poor building maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Broken Windows and Doors:</strong> Affecting security and insulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you live with any of these issues and your landlord has failed to fix them after you reported them, you may have grounds to make a <strong>housing disrepair claim</strong>.</p>

      <h2 id="section3-title">Your Legal Rights as a Tenant Facing Housing Disrepair</h2>
      <p>UK law protects tenants from living in substandard housing. Important legislation includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Landlord and Tenant Act 1985:</strong> Requires landlords to keep the structure and exterior of the property, including installations such as plumbing and heating, in good repair.</li>
        <li><strong>Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018:</strong> Ensures rented properties are safe, healthy, and free from serious hazards.</li>
        <li><strong>Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS):</strong> Used by local councils to assess and enforce housing standards and hazards.</li>
        <li><strong>Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998:</strong> Requires annual safety checks of gas appliances by registered engineers.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrical Safety Standards 2020:</strong> Mandates regular electrical inspections in rented homes to ensure safety.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your landlord fails to comply with these duties and neglects repairs after you notify them, you have legal grounds to pursue a claim.</p>

      <h2 id="section6-title">How the Housing Disrepair Claims Process Works</h2>
      <p>Navigating a housing disrepair claim can seem daunting, but we make the process straightforward. Here's an overview of the typical stages:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1 – Free Online Claim Check:</strong> Start by completing our simple, secure online form detailing your housing issues. This step is free with no obligation.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2 – Case Assessment:</strong> Our specialist team reviews your information to determine your eligibility and the strength of your claim.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3 – Solicitor Referral:</strong> If you qualify, we connect you with an experienced, regulated housing disrepair solicitor who will handle your case.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4 – Communication with Landlord:</strong> Your solicitor will formally contact your landlord to demand repairs and compensation.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5 – Expert Survey and Evidence Gathering:</strong> Often, an independent surveyor will inspect your property to assess the disrepair and its impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6 – Negotiation or Court Proceedings:</strong> Most cases settle out of court after negotiation. If necessary, your solicitor can initiate legal action to enforce repairs and claim damages.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7 – Repairs and Compensation:</strong> Repairs are carried out and compensation awarded for distress, inconvenience, and property damage.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="section12-title">Housing Disrepair Questions & Answers</h2>

      <h3>Can private tenants make housing disrepair claims?</h3>
      <p>Yes, private tenants and social housing tenants alike have the right to make claims if their landlord fails to maintain the property in good repair and this causes problems.</p>

      <h3>How long does a housing disrepair claim usually take?</h3>
      <p>Claims vary depending on complexity and landlord cooperation, but most cases resolve within 6 to 12 months.</p>

      <h3>Will I need to attend court for my claim?</h3>
      <p>Most claims settle out of court. Your solicitor will advise if court action is necessary.</p>

      <h3>Is there a limit to how much compensation I can claim?</h3>
      <p>Compensation varies based on the severity, duration, and impact of the disrepair. Awards range from hundreds to tens of thousands of pounds.</p>

      <h3>What if my landlord refuses to fix the problem?</h3>
      <p>Your solicitor can take legal steps to compel repairs and claim damages on your behalf.</p>

      <h3>Do I have to prove that the disrepair caused me harm?</h3>
      <p>While not always necessary, medical evidence or expert reports strengthen your case significantly.</p>

      <h3>Can I claim if I rent from a council or housing association?</h3>
      <p>Yes, tenants of local authorities and housing associations have the same rights to claim as private tenants.</p>

      <h3>What if I need to move out during repairs?</h3>

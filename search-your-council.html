  <h2>Why It’s Important to Know Your Council</h2>
  <p>Every local authority in the UK has a legal duty to maintain safe and habitable homes for its tenants. If you're living in social housing or council-provided accommodation, your local council is responsible for ensuring that repairs are handled promptly and that your living conditions meet health and safety standards. Issues like mould, damp, leaks, broken heating, or structural damage are not just inconveniences — they may be considered legal disrepair.</p>
  <p>By finding your council using our search tool, you can take the first step toward holding them accountable and protecting your rights as a tenant. <a href="how-it-works.html">Learn how housing disrepair claims work here</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>How Housing Disrepair Affects Your Health</h2>
  <p>Living with damp, mould, or broken facilities can have a serious impact on your wellbeing. Many tenants suffer from respiratory issues, anxiety, and stress due to unresolved disrepair. Councils and housing associations must address these risks — and if they don’t, you may be eligible to claim compensation or force the repairs to be done.</p>
  <p>Common symptoms of housing disrepair include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Persistent cold and condensation inside the home</li>
    <li>Mould-related breathing problems or allergies</li>
    <li>Leaks causing damage to walls, ceilings or electrics</li>
    <li>Lack of hot water or heating during cold months</li>
  </ul>

<div class="section">
  <h2>What If My Council Ignores Me?</h2>
  <p>Many tenants report chasing their council for months or even years with no progress. If you've reported issues and your landlord hasn’t fixed them within a reasonable time, you have legal options. Housing disrepair claims help you take back control, get repairs completed, and potentially receive compensation for distress or inconvenience.</p>
  <p>We work with professional firms who handle council complaints and legal processes for you. Whether it’s damp, leaks, faulty electrics, or unsafe living conditions, our experts will support your case.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Can I Still Claim If I’m On Benefits?</h2>
  <p>Yes. Being on Universal Credit, Housing Benefit, or other forms of support does not stop you from making a housing disrepair claim. In fact, many people in social housing are eligible. These claims are usually no-win, no-fee, meaning you don’t need to pay anything upfront to begin the process.</p>
  <p>Whether you’re on a low income or out of work, you still deserve a safe home. <a href="faq.html">Read our FAQs</a> for more help on claiming while on benefits.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Need Help With Rent Arrears Too?</h2>
  <p>Many tenants struggling with housing disrepair are also behind on rent. If your council hasn’t fixed your property, they may still be chasing you for arrears — even if the issues caused damage or made parts of your home unliveable. This is unfair, and you may have legal grounds to defend yourself.</p>
  <p>In some cases, we can also help you explore solutions for rent debt and other bills. If you have debts piling up, check out our sister site <a href=\"https://freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk\">Fresh Start Debt Support</a> for help with council tax, credit cards, and more.</p>

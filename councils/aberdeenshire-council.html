    <h1>Aberdeenshire Council Housing Disrepair Claims</h1>
    <p>If you rent your home from <strong>Aberdeenshire Council</strong> and are living in poor housing conditions due to <strong>damp, mould, leaks, broken heating, faulty electrics, or structural problems</strong>, you may be eligible for <strong>housing disrepair compensation</strong>. At <strong>Home Justice Solutions</strong>, we help tenants across Aberdeenshire claim what they're rightfully owed when the council fails in its duty of care.</p>
    <p>Aberdeenshire Council, like all local authorities, has a legal obligation to maintain its housing stock. When essential repairs are ignored — even after repeated reports — tenants suffer both physically and financially. If this sounds familiar, we can help you take action today.</p>

    <h2>What Counts as Housing Disrepair in Aberdeenshire?</h2>
    <p>Tenants across Stonehaven, Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Inverurie, and other Aberdeenshire towns frequently report problems such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Black mould spreading in bathrooms and bedrooms</li>
      <li>Persistent condensation and damp due to poor ventilation</li>
      <li>Leaking roofs, gutters, or pipes causing water damage</li>
      <li>Broken boilers or lack of central heating in winter</li>
      <li>Faulty electrics or dangerous wiring</li>
      <li>Cracks in walls, rotting windows, or collapsing ceilings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are not just minor issues — they can cause serious health risks, especially for children, the elderly, or those with existing medical conditions.</p>

    <h2>Your Legal Rights as a Council Tenant in Aberdeenshire</h2>
    <p>Under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2001/10/contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Housing (Scotland) Act 2001</a>, Aberdeenshire Council must keep your home in a reasonable state of repair. If you've reported an issue and the council hasn’t fixed it in a reasonable time, you can bring a claim for compensation.</p>
    <p>You also have a right to live in a safe, warm, and watertight home — and to be free from the stress, discomfort, and property damage caused by long-term disrepair.</p>
    <p>For additional help on tenant rights, you can visit <a href="https://scotland.shelter.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shelter Scotland</a>.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Can You Claim Compensation For?</h2>
    <p>Depending on your situation, you may be entitled to claim compensation for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Health issues caused by mould, damp or cold</li>
      <li>Damage to belongings (clothes, furniture, electronics)</li>
      <li>Disruption and inconvenience</li>
      <li>Cost of alternative accommodation (if applicable)</li>
      <li>Loss of use of part of your home</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In many cases, tenants have received <strong>£1,000 – £10,000 or more</strong> in compensation. If you've suffered due to inaction from Aberdeenshire Council, you may be entitled too.</p>

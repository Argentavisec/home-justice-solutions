    <!-- Section 1: Understanding Housing Disrepair -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="understanding-disrepair">
      <h2 id="understanding-disrepair">What Is Housing Disrepair and How Does It Affect You?</h2>
      <p>Housing disrepair refers to defects and maintenance failures in rented properties that negatively impact safety, habitability, or comfort. Common types of disrepair include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dampness and mould growth caused by water ingress or poor ventilation</li>
        <li>Leaking roofs, windows, or plumbing systems</li>
        <li>Faulty heating systems and lack of hot water</li>
        <li>Electrical hazards such as exposed wiring or faulty appliances</li>
        <li>Structural damage including cracks, subsidence, or unstable floors</li>
        <li>Broken windows, doors, locks, or security features</li>
        <li>Pest infestations resulting from neglect</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Living in disrepair can lead to serious health problems such as respiratory illnesses, allergies, infections, and mental health stress. It can also cause property damage and reduce your quality of life.</p>
      <p>As a tenant, you have the right to expect your home to be safe, warm, and dry. When these standards are not met, the law holds landlords and councils accountable to carry out repairs promptly and compensate tenants for harm suffered.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2: Aberdeenshire Council's Legal Duties -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="council-legal-duties">
      <h2 id="council-legal-duties">Aberdeenshire Council’s Legal Responsibilities in Housing Repairs</h2>
      <p>Aberdeenshire Council is bound by Scottish housing laws to ensure all council properties meet the Repairing Standard and are safe and habitable. Their legal duties include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintaining the structure and exterior of the property</li>
        <li>Ensuring installations like heating, plumbing, and electrics are safe and functioning</li>
        <li>Responding quickly and effectively to repair requests</li>
        <li>Enforcing standards with private landlords in Aberdeenshire</li>
        <li>Providing tenant advice and support related to disrepair</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The council publishes official repair timescales which vary by urgency. For example, emergencies such as no heating in winter should be fixed within 24 hours, while less urgent repairs have longer timeframes.</p>
      <p>If Aberdeenshire Council fails to meet these duties, tenants can escalate complaints, seek enforcement action, and pursue compensation claims.</p>

      <p>Tenants across Aberdeenshire frequently report:</p>

      <h3>Damp and Mould</h3>

      <p>Broken boilers or radiators often leave tenants without adequate heating or hot water, especially problematic during harsh winters.</p>

      <h3>Leaks and Water Damage</h3>
      <p>Roof leaks or faulty plumbing result in water stains, rot, and structural damage.</p>

      <h3>Electrical Hazards</h3>
      <p>Unsafe wiring, outdated fuse boxes, or exposed cables create fire and shock risks.</p>

      <h3>Structural Faults</h3>
      <p>Cracks, subsidence, and unstable floors require urgent attention to ensure safety.</p>

      <h3>Pest Infestations</h3>
      <p>Rodents and insects can invade homes due to poor maintenance or disrepair.</p>

      <h3>How do I report housing disrepair to Aberdeenshire Council?</h3>
      <p>You can report disrepair by using Aberdeenshire Council’s online repair reporting system, calling their housing repairs hotline for urgent issues, or sending a detailed written complaint including photos or videos.</p>

      <h3>Can I withhold rent if repairs are not done?</h3>
      <p>Withholding rent is generally not advised without legal advice, as it can lead to eviction. Instead, document your repair requests and seek legal support or use rent escrow schemes under guidance.</p>

      <h3>What compensation can I claim for housing disrepair?</h3>
      <p>You may claim compensation for inconvenience, distress, health issues, damaged belongings, temporary accommodation costs, and legal fees. The amount varies depending on the severity and impact of the disrepair.</p>

      <h3>Do I need a solicitor to make a housing disrepair claim?</h3>

      <h3>What if Aberdeenshire Council ignores my repair requests?</h3>

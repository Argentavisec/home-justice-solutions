    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="adur-council-responsibilities">
      <h2 id="adur-council-responsibilities">Adur District Council’s Role and Legal Responsibilities in Housing Repairs</h2>
      <p>Adur District Council, as a landlord of social and council housing, is legally required under the Housing Act 2004 and other regulations to maintain properties to the Decent Homes Standard and ensure they are safe, warm, and free from health hazards.</p>
      <p>The Council’s housing repairs department is responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Responding promptly to tenant reports of disrepair and hazards</li>
        <li>Inspecting properties and identifying defects such as damp, mould, heating failures, and structural faults</li>
        <li>Arranging repairs within specified timescales, prioritising urgent and emergency works</li>
        <li>Enforcing repair obligations on private landlords where applicable</li>
        <li>Providing advice and support services to tenants facing disrepair</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Council publishes clear repair timescales, e.g., emergency heating repairs are typically resolved within 24 hours, urgent repairs within 7 days, and routine repairs within 28 days.</p>
      <p>If the Council fails in its duties, tenants have the right to escalate complaints to the Housing Ombudsman or seek legal enforcement and compensation through the courts.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Common Disrepair Issues -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="common-adur-issues">
      <h2 id="common-adur-issues">Common Housing Disrepair Issues Reported to Adur District Council</h2>
      <p>Tenants in the Adur District frequently face the following disrepair problems:</p>

      <h3>Damp and Mould</h3>
      <p>Dampness and mould are common due to the coastal climate, poor ventilation, and older housing stock. Persistent damp causes wall and floor damage and aggravates respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis.</p>

      <h3>Heating and Hot Water Failures</h3>
      <p>Malfunctioning boilers, radiators, and hot water systems often leave tenants without adequate heating, especially during cold months, severely affecting quality of life.</p>

      <h3>Leaks and Water Damage</h3>
      <p>Roof leaks, broken gutters, and plumbing faults lead to water ingress that damages ceilings, walls, and flooring, potentially causing structural decay.</p>

      <h3>Electrical Faults and Hazards</h3>
      <p>Outdated or faulty wiring, exposed cables, and defective appliances pose serious fire and electric shock risks that require immediate attention.</p>

      <h3>Structural Problems</h3>
      <p>Issues like wall cracks, subsidence, or unstable flooring threaten tenant safety and require professional assessment and urgent repairs.</p>

      <h3>Pest Infestations</h3>
      <p>Rodents and insects often invade homes suffering neglect or poor maintenance, creating health and hygiene concerns.</p>

      <h2 id="faqs-adur">Frequently Asked Questions About Adur District Council Housing Disrepair Claims</h2>

      <h3>What qualifies as housing disrepair?</h3>
      <p>Housing disrepair covers defects or neglect affecting your home's safety, health, or comfort, including damp, mould, leaks, faulty heating or electrics, structural damage, and pests.</p>

      <h3>How do I report housing disrepair to Adur District Council?</h3>

      <h3>Can I withhold rent if repairs are not done?</h3>

      <p>Escalate complaints to the Housing Ombudsman or seek legal advice.</p>

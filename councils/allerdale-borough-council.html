    <h1>Allerdale Borough Council Housing Disrepair Claims</h1>
    <p>Are you a tenant of Allerdale Borough Council or a housing association property in the area? If your living conditions are affected by damp, black mould, water leaks, faulty electrics or other disrepair, you may be eligible to claim compensation. At <strong>Home Justice Solutions</strong>, we help tenants hold their landlords accountable — making the legal process simple, fast and completely no win, no fee.</p>
    <p>Housing disrepair isn’t just inconvenient — it can pose serious health risks, damage your belongings and negatively impact your mental wellbeing. You have legal rights, and Allerdale Borough Council has legal responsibilities. If they’ve failed to fix reported issues within a reasonable timeframe, it’s time to act.</p>

    <h2>What Issues Can You Claim For?</h2>
    <p>Many tenants we speak to in the Allerdale area face serious housing issues — often ignored or delayed by their council landlord. Here are common examples of disrepair that may qualify for compensation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Black mould growing on walls, ceilings or windows</li>
      <li>Persistent damp and condensation</li>
      <li>Leaking roofs, windows, or radiators</li>
      <li>Broken boilers or heating systems</li>
      <li>Faulty or dangerous electrical wiring</li>
      <li>Pest infestations due to poor property condition</li>
      <li>Cracked walls, broken tiles, or rotting woodwork</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are not just minor issues. They can cause health problems such as asthma, infections and anxiety. Your landlord has a legal duty under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 to keep your home in good repair.</p>

    <h2>Are You Eligible for Compensation?</h2>
    <p>If you've reported issues to Allerdale Borough Council and they've failed to act within a reasonable time (usually 21–28 days), you may have a valid claim. Even if they made repairs eventually, delays and inadequate fixes could still make you eligible. You do <strong>not</strong> have to move out to claim, and you don't need to pay anything upfront.</p>
    <p>We work with housing disrepair solicitors who specialise in council housing claims — and they operate on a strict <strong>no win, no fee</strong> basis. That means no financial risk to you.</p>

    <h2>Recent Issues in Allerdale Properties</h2>
    <p>Through helping tenants across <a href="https://www.allerdale.gov.uk/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allerdale</a> including Workington, Maryport, Wigton and Cockermouth, we've identified recurring patterns in council neglect:</p>

      <li>Years of ignored complaints about black mould</li>
      <li>Tenants left without working heating systems in winter</li>
      <li>Vulnerable residents not being prioritised for repairs</li>

    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="understanding-disrepair-portsmouth">
      <h2 id="understanding-disrepair-portsmouth">Understanding Housing Disrepair and Its Impact in Portsmouth</h2>
      <p>Housing disrepair includes any defects or failures in a property’s structure, fixtures, or installations that affect its safety, habitability, or comfort. Common problems faced by tenants in Portsmouth include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Persistent damp and mould growth caused by water ingress or inadequate ventilation</li>
        <li>Leaking roofs, broken windows, or faulty plumbing systems</li>
        <li>Heating failures, including broken boilers, radiators, or lack of hot water</li>
        <li>Electrical faults, exposed wiring, or unsafe installations</li>
        <li>Structural problems like cracks, subsidence, or unstable floors</li>
        <li>Pest infestations due to poor maintenance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Living with housing disrepair not only affects the condition of your home but can cause serious health issues like asthma, respiratory infections, allergies, and mental health problems. It can also reduce your quality of life and safety.</p>
      <p>In Portsmouth, the council and landlords have legal obligations to maintain homes and ensure repairs are carried out promptly. Tenants have the right to demand these repairs and claim compensation if their homes fall below acceptable standards.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Portsmouth Council’s Legal Responsibilities in Housing Disrepair -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="portsmouth-council-responsibilities">
      <h2 id="portsmouth-council-responsibilities">Portsmouth Council’s Legal Responsibilities in Housing Disrepair</h2>
      <p>Portsmouth City Council is legally required to ensure council-owned and managed properties meet the Repairing Standard under UK housing law. Their duties include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintaining the structure and exterior of properties, including roofs and walls</li>
        <li>Keeping heating, plumbing, and electrical systems safe and operational</li>
        <li>Responding promptly to reports of disrepair and hazards</li>
        <li>Carrying out necessary repairs within defined timescales based on urgency</li>
        <li>Enforcing repair standards on private landlords through inspections and enforcement actions</li>
        <li>Providing advice and support to tenants about housing disrepair</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The council’s official repair standards outline expected timescales, such as 24 hours for emergencies like no heating in winter, and longer periods for less urgent issues.</p>
      <p>Failure by the council to meet these obligations allows tenants to escalate complaints, request enforcement action, and pursue legal claims for compensation.</p>

      <h2 id="common-issues-portsmouth">Common Housing Disrepair Issues Reported in Portsmouth</h2>
      <p>Tenants across Portsmouth frequently experience a variety of disrepair problems, including:</p>

      <h3>Damp and Mould</h3>
      <p>Due to Hampshire’s coastal climate and older housing stock, persistent damp and mould are widespread issues. These conditions damage property fabric and contribute to respiratory illnesses.</p>

      <h3>Heating and Hot Water Failures</h3>
      <p>Failures in boilers, radiators, or hot water systems can leave tenants without adequate warmth or hot water, especially difficult in colder months.</p>

      <h3>Leaks and Water Damage</h3>
      <p>Leaking roofs, pipes, or defective windows cause water damage to walls, ceilings, and floors, often worsening over time.</p>

      <h3>Electrical Faults and Hazards</h3>
      <p>Outdated wiring, exposed cables, and unsafe appliances present fire and shock risks to tenants.</p>

      <h3>Structural Defects</h3>
      <p>Cracks, subsidence, and foundation issues can threaten the safety and stability of homes and require urgent attention.</p>

      <h3>Pest Infestations</h3>
      <p>Rodents, cockroaches, and other pests often invade homes where disrepair leads to gaps or damp conditions.</p>

    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="faq-portsmouth">
      <h2 id="faq-portsmouth">Frequently Asked Questions About Housing Disrepair in Portsmouth</h2>

      <h3>What counts as housing disrepair in Portsmouth?</h3>
      <p>Housing disrepair includes any defect or maintenance failure that affects your safety, health, or comfort — such as damp, mould, leaks, faulty heating, electrical hazards, or structural damage.</p>

      <h3>How do I report housing disrepair to Portsmouth City Council?</h3>
      <p>You can report issues through the council’s online portal, by phone to their repairs hotline, or via a detailed written complaint including photos or videos.</p>

      <h3>How long does Portsmouth City Council take to complete repairs?</h3>
      <p>Repair timescales depend on urgency. Emergency repairs typically have a 24-hour target, while non-urgent repairs may take several weeks. The council’s published repair standards give more details.</p>

      <h3>Can I withhold rent if repairs are not done?</h3>
      <p>Withholding rent is generally not advised without legal advice, as it can risk eviction. Instead, document repair requests and seek legal support or use rent escrow schemes if appropriate.</p>

      <h3>What compensation can I claim for housing disrepair?</h3>
      <p>Compensation may cover inconvenience, distress, medical costs, damaged belongings, temporary accommodation, and legal fees, depending on your case’s severity and impact.</p>

      <h3>Do I need a solicitor for a housing disrepair claim?</h3>
      <p>While you can claim yourself, specialist solicitors increase success chances by helping with evidence, negotiations, and court proceedings.</p>

      <h3>What if Portsmouth City Council ignores my repair requests?</h3>
      <p>If ignored or delayed, escalate through the council’s complaints process, tenant support organisations, or seek legal advice. You can also report to the Housing Ombudsman.</p>

      <h3>Can private tenants make housing disrepair claims in Portsmouth?</h3>
      <p>Yes, private tenants can pursue claims if landlords fail to maintain properties. The council may also enforce standards on private landlords.</p>

      <h3>How long do I have to make a housing disrepair claim?</h3>
      <p>The general limitation period in England is six years from when the disrepair was first known. Acting promptly strengthens your claim.</p>

      <h3>What is Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)?</h3>
      <p>ADR includes mediation and arbitration as quicker, less adversarial alternatives to court, helping tenants and landlords reach agreements efficiently.</p>

      <h3>How can Home Justice Solutions assist me?</h3>
      <p>We offer free eligibility assessments, connect you with no win, no fee solicitors, and provide support through all claim stages.</p>

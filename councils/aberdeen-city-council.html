    <h1>Aberdeen City Council Housing Disrepair Claims</h1>
    <p>Are you living in an <strong>Aberdeen City Council</strong> property that’s in poor condition? Struggling with <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lung-chest-and-breathing/asthma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asthma</a> or illness from damp and mould? Leaks, faulty electrics, broken heating or structural issues could all be signs of serious <strong>housing disrepair</strong> — and you may be eligible to claim compensation.</p>
    
    <p>At <strong>Home Justice Solutions</strong>, we help Aberdeen council tenants like you take legal action against poor housing conditions. We work with specialist housing solicitors who operate on a <strong>no win, no fee</strong> basis, so you pay nothing upfront. Your health, safety, and comfort in your home matter — and the council has a legal duty to maintain livable standards under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/68/section/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Landlord and Tenant Act 1985</a>.</p>

    <p>Compensation payouts often range from hundreds to <strong>thousands of pounds</strong>, especially in cases involving long-standing neglect, repeated complaints, or health damage.</p>

    <h2>What Can I Claim Compensation For?</h2>
    <p>If Aberdeen City Council has failed to repair your home despite repeated complaints or delays, you may be entitled to claim for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Respiratory illnesses</strong> caused by mould or damp (e.g., asthma, chest infections)</li>
      <li><strong>Damage to belongings</strong> such as furniture, clothing or electricals from leaks</li>
      <li><strong>Stress, inconvenience and discomfort</strong> caused by prolonged disrepair</li>
      <li><strong>Temporary accommodation or relocation</strong> costs (in severe cases)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also help you collect evidence to support your claim — such as medical records, photos of damage, complaint logs, and housing inspection reports.</p>

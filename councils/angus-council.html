    <h1>Claim Compensation from Angus Council for Housing Disrepair</h1>
    <p>Living in an Angus Council property that is damp, mouldy, or unsafe? You're not alone. Tenants across Arbroath, Forfar, Montrose, and surrounding areas are reporting poor housing conditions — and many don't realise they're legally entitled to compensation. At Home Justice Solutions, we help council tenants like you take action and receive the justice you deserve.</p>
    <p>If you've reported problems such as mould, leaks, broken heating, or structural damage and Angus Council failed to repair them within a reasonable time, you could be owed £1,000s in compensation.</p>

    <h2>What Counts as Housing Disrepair?</h2>
    <p>Housing disrepair refers to serious maintenance issues that affect your comfort, health, or safety. These problems must have been reported to the council or landlord and left unresolved for a significant period.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Black mould or damp causing breathing problems</li>
      <li>Leaky pipes, roofs, or windows leading to water damage</li>
      <li>Faulty heating or no hot water</li>
      <li>Broken electrics, unsafe stairs or floors</li>
      <li>Rodent infestations or structural damage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're experiencing any of these, especially if it’s affecting your health, belongings, or peace of mind, you're entitled to take legal action.</p>

    <h2>Health Risks from Mould & Damp in Angus Homes</h2>
    <p>Many families across Angus suffer from ongoing health problems due to black mould, condensation, and cold, damp homes. Common issues include:</p>

      <li>Worsening of asthma and respiratory issues</li>
      <li>Skin rashes, eye irritation, headaches</li>
      <li>Children falling ill more frequently</li>

    <p>Disrepair isn’t just inconvenient — it’s dangerous. If your council housing has made you or your family ill, you may be entitled to medical-related compensation in addition to general damages.</p>

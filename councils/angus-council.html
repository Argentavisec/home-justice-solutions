  <h2>Understanding Your Rights as a Tenant</h2>
  <p>As a tenant in a council-owned property, you have a legal right to live in a safe, well-maintained home. If Angus Council fails to respond to your repair requests within a reasonable timeframe, they may be in breach of their responsibilities under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006. You do not need to suffer in silence. Disrepair can impact your health, safety, and overall quality of life—and legal action can result in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Financial compensation for inconvenience and hardship</li>
    <li>Repairs being completed quickly</li>
    <li>Reimbursement for damage to belongings</li>
    <li>Compensation for health-related issues caused by poor housing conditions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you’re unsure whether you qualify, you can explore <a href="claim-types.html">what types of claims you can make</a> on our website.</p>

  <h2>Common Housing Disrepair Issues in Angus</h2>
  <p>Through our work across Scotland, we’ve seen recurring housing issues reported by Angus Council tenants. These problems are often ignored or delayed by the council, leaving tenants in unsafe conditions. Some of the most common disrepair issues include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Black mould and damp caused by poor ventilation and leaks</li>
    <li>Faulty or broken heating systems in winter</li>
    <li>Unsafe electrics and exposed wiring</li>
    <li>Leaking roofs or windows leading to water damage</li>
    <li>Structural damage, including cracks, loose tiles, or collapsing ceilings</li>
    <li>Pest infestations due to broken seals or poor hygiene from neighbouring properties</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you’ve already reported one or more of these issues and the council has failed to act within a reasonable period, you may be entitled to claim. Take the first step today by using our quick online form.</p>

  <h2>Why Take Action Now?</h2>
  <p>The longer you wait, the harder it can be to prove your case—especially if new damage arises or the council makes partial repairs that mask underlying problems. If Angus Council has already been notified but hasn’t taken meaningful steps, the law is on your side. You could be awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Physical and mental health impacts</li>
    <li>Damage to belongings or furniture</li>
    <li>Inconvenience and stress</li>
    <li>Alternative accommodation costs (if applicable)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may also be able to secure court-ordered repairs. Don’t let your living conditions worsen—speak to us today for expert advice and action.</p>

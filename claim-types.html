    <h1>What Housing Disrepair Can You Claim For?</h1>
    <p>Many tenants in the UK are living in homes that are unsafe, unhealthy, or simply unfit for human habitation. If you’ve told your <a href="search-your-council.html">council or housing association</a> about repairs needed in your home — and nothing has been done — you may be entitled to make a <strong>housing disrepair claim</strong>.</p>
    <p>Below are the most common types of disrepair issues that affect tenants. If any of these apply to you, you may be eligible for <strong>repairs and financial compensation</strong>.</p>
    <p>We also recommend reviewing <a href="tenant-rights.html">Your Tenant Rights</a> to understand your legal protection under the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>✅ Damp & Black Mould</h2>
    <p>Damp patches and black mould are among the most dangerous forms of disrepair, especially for children, the elderly, or those with respiratory conditions. If your landlord has failed to act despite reports, this could be grounds for a claim.</p>
    <p>Mould is often caused by poor ventilation, rising damp, or leaks. It can trigger asthma, cause skin irritation, and severely affect mental wellbeing. If you or a family member has been harmed, you may be owed <strong>thousands in compensation</strong>.</p>
    <p><a href="how-it-works.html">See how our claim process works</a> and protect your health.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>✅ Leaks & Water Damage</h2>
    <p>Persistent leaks from the roof, bathroom, or kitchen pipes can lead to rotting floorboards, mould, and collapsing ceilings. These aren’t just cosmetic issues — they’re dangerous, and your landlord is legally required to fix them.</p>
    <p>Water damage can also ruin your furniture, flooring, and clothing. If your landlord has ignored your reports, <a href="faq.html">read our FAQs</a> or <a href="how-it-works.html">learn how to make a claim</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>✅ No Heating or Hot Water</h2>
    <p>Living without a working boiler, radiator, or hot water system is not only uncomfortable — it can be a breach of your human rights. Landlords must ensure properties are habitable and warm, especially during the winter months.</p>
    <p>If you’ve had to live without heating or hot water for weeks or even months, this is a major disrepair issue. You may be entitled to repairs and <strong>backdated compensation</strong>.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>✅ Unsafe Electrics</h2>
    <p>Exposed wires, faulty light fittings, sparking sockets, or broken fuse boxes can be extremely dangerous. If you’ve reported the issues and your landlord hasn’t taken action, they could be breaking the law.</p>
    <p>Tenants are protected under multiple UK regulations that require landlords to maintain safe electrical systems. If ignored, you may be entitled to legal help and a financial award.</p>
    <p><a href="faq.html">See common questions about disrepair compensation</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>✅ Rodents, Cockroaches & Pests</h2>
    <p>Infestations of rats, mice, silverfish or cockroaches can be a result of poor maintenance — such as holes in brickwork, damp, or bad plumbing. These infestations can affect your health, food safety, and general wellbeing.</p>
    <p>If your landlord has not dealt with repeated pest reports, this is grounds for a claim. Housing disrepair law allows tenants to pursue legal action when infestations are linked to disrepair.</p>
    <p>Check our <a href="claim-types.html">claim types page</a> for more examples of common problems.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>✅ Structural Damage & Safety Hazards</h2>
    <p>Broken windows, cracked walls, collapsing ceilings, or damaged stairs are clear signs that your property may be unsafe to live in. These can cause serious injury and pose a risk to children and elderly tenants.</p>
    <p>Structural issues may also violate your local council’s health and safety requirements. If your home is unsafe and your landlord hasn’t acted, <strong>you could claim for repair and compensation</strong>.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>✅ Other Disrepair Issues</h2>
    <p>You may also be eligible to claim if your landlord has failed to fix:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Broken front doors or windows that risk your security</li>
      <li>Unusable kitchen appliances supplied by the landlord</li>
      <li>Loose railings, stair banisters, or balcony damage</li>
      <li>Blocked drains or overflowing gutters</li>
      <li>Any health hazard that affects your safety</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even if you're unsure whether your issue qualifies, it's worth completing our short claim check. Our partners will assess your case and let you know if you could proceed.</p>

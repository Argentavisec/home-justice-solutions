    <!-- Section 2: What is Housing Disrepair? -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="what-is-disrepair">
      <h2 id="what-is-disrepair">What is Housing Disrepair?</h2>
      <p>Housing disrepair refers to faults, defects, or damages within a rental property that significantly affect the condition, safety, or livability of the home. These problems typically violate the landlord’s legal duty to keep the property in good repair.</p>
      <p>Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Damp patches and mould growth</li>
        <li>Broken heating or hot water systems</li>
        <li>Leaking roofs, pipes, or plumbing</li>
        <li>Faulty or unsafe electrics</li>
        <li>Broken windows, doors, or locks</li>
        <li>Structural damage such as cracks or subsidence</li>
        <li>Pest infestations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Living in such conditions can cause health problems, damage belongings, and disrupt daily life. As a tenant, you have the right to demand repairs and compensation where your landlord has neglected their responsibilities.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Your Legal Rights as a Tenant -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="tenant-legal-rights">
      <h2 id="tenant-legal-rights">Your Legal Rights as a Tenant</h2>
      <p>UK tenants are protected by several laws ensuring landlords maintain rental properties properly. Key legislation includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Landlord and Tenant Act 1985:</strong> Requires landlords to keep property structure and installations in good repair.</li>
        <li><strong>Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018:</strong> Mandates that rented homes be safe, healthy, and free from serious disrepair.</li>
        <li><strong>Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS):</strong> Used by councils to assess housing hazards affecting tenant health and safety.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your landlord breaches these duties, you can take action to enforce repairs and seek compensation.</p>
      <p>You also have protection against retaliatory eviction or harassment when making a legitimate disrepair claim.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: Common Types of Housing Disrepair Claims -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="common-claim-types">
      <h2 id="common-claim-types">Common Types of Housing Disrepair Claims</h2>
      <p>Disrepair claims vary depending on the specific problems in your home. Below are the most frequent types we handle, each requiring tailored evidence and approach:</p>

      <h3>Damp and Mould Claims</h3>
      <p>Damp and mould can result from leaks, condensation, or poor ventilation. They pose serious health risks such as asthma, bronchitis, and allergies. Claims typically cover health impacts, damage to property, and distress caused by these conditions.</p>

      <h3>Heating Failure Claims</h3>
      <p>Landlords must provide functional heating and hot water. Broken boilers, radiators, or water heaters can make a home unsafe and uncomfortable, especially during cold months. Claims seek compensation for health risks and inconvenience.</p>

      <h3>Leaks and Water Damage Claims</h3>
      <p>Leaks from roofs or plumbing can cause water damage to walls, ceilings, floors, and personal belongings. Claims cover property damage and delays in repairs.</p>

      <h3>Electrical Fault Claims</h3>
      <p>Unsafe electrics can cause shocks, fire, or injury. Claims relate to faulty wiring, missing safety certificates, or dangerous installations.</p>

      <h3>Broken Windows, Doors, and Security Claims</h3>
      <p>Damaged or missing windows and doors reduce security and comfort, increasing heating costs and safety risks.</p>

      <h3>Structural Damage and Subsidence Claims</h3>
      <p>Structural faults such as large cracks or subsidence affect safety and habitability. These claims often require expert surveys.</p>

      <h3>Pest Infestation Claims</h3>
      <p>Infestations due to neglect can damage health and property, entitling tenants to compensation and repairs.</p>

    <!-- Section: Understanding Mould and Damp Claims -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="mould-damp-claims">
      <h2 id="mould-damp-claims">Understanding Mould and Damp Claims: Protecting Your Health and Home</h2>
      <p>Mould and damp are among the most widespread and harmful problems faced by tenants in disrepair situations. Caused by water ingress, leaks, poor ventilation, or structural faults, they not only damage your home but also pose significant health risks.</p>

      <p>Exposure to black mould and persistent damp conditions is linked to respiratory illnesses, allergies, asthma attacks, and even more serious conditions such as bronchitis. Vulnerable individuals like children, elderly people, and those with existing health issues are especially at risk.</p>

      <p>From a legal perspective, mould and damp are strong grounds for a housing disrepair claim when landlords fail to address the underlying causes despite notifications. Successfully proving mould and damp claims often requires detailed evidence — including dated photographs, expert inspections, and medical records.</p>

      <p>Our team helps tenants compile this crucial evidence and understand the legal standards landlords must meet. We advise on the best course of action, whether that’s informal negotiation, council involvement, or formal legal claims.</p>

      <p>With our help, you can demand effective repairs to eradicate mould and damp, seek compensation for the distress and health impacts caused, and ensure your home is restored to a safe condition.</p>

    <!-- Section: Compensation Claims - What You Can Claim For -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="compensation-claims">
      <h2 id="compensation-claims">Compensation Claims: What You Can Claim For in Housing Disrepair</h2>
      <p>If your landlord has neglected repairs leading to disrepair, you may be entitled to claim compensation. This isn’t just about fixing the damage — compensation recognises the financial and personal toll caused by living in substandard conditions.</p>

      <p>Compensation claims can cover a variety of losses, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inconvenience and Distress:</strong> Living with damp, mould, or other disrepair causes stress, anxiety, and disrupts your day-to-day life. Courts acknowledge this impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Health-Related Costs:</strong> If you’ve suffered illness or injury due to disrepair, compensation can cover medical expenses, treatments, and related pain and suffering.</li>
        <li><strong>Damage to Personal Property:</strong> Water leaks and damp can ruin furniture, electronics, clothing, and other belongings. Compensation can include the replacement or repair of these items.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary Relocation Costs:</strong> In severe cases where you must move out for repairs, you can claim for temporary accommodation and associated expenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of Amenity:</strong> Reduced use and enjoyment of your home, for example, a damp bedroom or unusable living room, can form part of your claim.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We work with you to build a strong case by gathering robust evidence such as council inspection reports, expert surveys, medical documentation, and detailed records of landlord communications. This evidence is key to maximising your compensation award.</p>

      <p>Every claim is different, and compensation amounts depend on severity, duration, and the landlord’s behaviour. Our experienced advisors will guide you on realistic expectations and the best strategy.</p>

    <!-- Section: Council Enforcement & Tenant Rights Explained -->
    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="council-enforcement">
      <h2 id="council-enforcement">Council Enforcement and Your Tenant Rights</h2>
      <p>Local councils play a crucial role in protecting tenants from housing disrepair. Under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS), councils have the authority to inspect homes and enforce repairs when landlords fail to act.</p>

      <p>We assist tenants in making formal complaints to their local council’s housing enforcement team, helping you understand how to trigger inspections and what powers councils have. Enforcement actions can include serving improvement notices, hazard awareness notices, and even prosecuting landlords who ignore repair obligations.</p>

      <p>Knowing your tenant rights is essential. The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018 legally require landlords to maintain their properties in safe, healthy conditions. These laws underpin council enforcement and your ability to seek redress.</p>

      <p>Our advisors explain how to use council resources effectively and support you through the sometimes complex bureaucratic processes. We advocate for your rights to safe housing at every stage.</p>

      <p>Housing disrepair can severely impact your physical and mental health. Common health problems linked to poor housing conditions include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li>
        <li>Allergic reactions and infections caused by mould spores and damp environments</li>

        <li>Accidents and injuries from faulty electrical systems, unstable structures, or slippery surfaces</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="covid-impact">How COVID-19 Has Affected Housing Disrepair and Repairs</h2>
      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic introduced new challenges in addressing housing disrepair. Lockdowns and social distancing caused delays in inspections, repairs, and legal processes, leaving many tenants in worsening conditions.</p>
      <p>Despite these difficulties, tenant rights remain protected, and landlords still have legal obligations to maintain safe, habitable homes. Governments and councils introduced temporary measures to support tenants, including eviction bans and prioritisation of urgent repairs.</p>
      <p>As services normalize, we help tenants navigate backlogs and pursue claims for delayed repairs and damages resulting from pandemic-related disruptions.</p>

    <div class="section" aria-labelledby="faqs">
      <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions About Housing Disrepair</h2>

      <h3>What counts as housing disrepair?</h3>
      <p>Housing disrepair includes any defects or neglect affecting the safety, health, or comfort of your home — such as damp, mould, leaks, broken heating, unsafe electrics, or structural faults.</p>

      <h3>How do I know if I can claim compensation?</h3>
      <p>If your landlord failed to repair serious issues after you reported them, and you suffered inconvenience, distress, or damage, you may be eligible for compensation.</p>

      <h3>What evidence do I need for a claim?</h3>
      <p>Collect dated photos, correspondence with your landlord, medical records if applicable, council inspection reports, and expert surveys.</p>

      <h3>Can I withhold rent if repairs aren’t done?</h3>
      <p>Withholding rent is risky and not generally advised without legal guidance, as it can lead to eviction. Instead, seek legal advice or use rent escrow schemes.</p>

      <h3>How long does a housing disrepair claim take?</h3>
      <p>Timescales vary from a few months for straightforward claims to over a year for complex cases, especially if court action is needed.</p>

      <h3>Will claiming disrepair affect my ability to rent in the future?</h3>
      <p>Legally, it shouldn’t, but some landlords may be hesitant. We advise keeping claims confidential and handled professionally.</p>
